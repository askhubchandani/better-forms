                        <article>
                            <p>A lot of webmasters, Developers these days are obsessed with improving the page load time of the website, finding the best possible fonts, colours and typography, in order to imorove the UX of the website/app. But what a lot of people forget is the point where the real contact happens between the user and the wesbite/app: The Contact Forms. </p>

                            <p>New HTML 5 specs have a lot of cool features, including helping in validation of forms without the need of server-side requirements or scripting By default inputs type like email or telephone numbers use a pattern that checks that the information filled is correct or not, and forms can be submitted when the user clicks on the submit bottom.</p>

                            <p>Here, I used a lot of patterns and validation controls in order to help the user to fill the forms. 
                            <b>required:</b>
                            This HTML attribute can be used with input and textarea. It indicates that the field should be filled out before the form is submitted. It is very useful to let user know that we need that information, for example the email or the phone number. </p>  
                            
                            <p><b>pattern:</b>
                            Another HTML attribute to check the information added by users. In that case we can build our own pattern or use one of the patterns by default. It depends on the type attribute. For example, if we use the email type, it will looking for an email string (with @ in the middle and a valid domain extension such as .com, .org or whatever.) However, the power of this attribute is that we can create our own pattern, excluding numbers for instance or any character we want to avoid. The pattern attribute requires a regular expression in order to work properly.</p>
                 
                            <p><b>placeholder:</b>
                            The most useful attribute in this collection for UX. It helps user to understand what kind of info we are looking for. It can also display an example data that will disappear when the user starts filling out the input (typing a character) and not when the input is :focus.</p>
